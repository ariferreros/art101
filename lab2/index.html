				<h1>Hello World</h1>
				<p>We are Ari and Emmet.
				<p>Emmet is a Computer Science: Game design major, and Ari  is a Computer Science major.</p>
				<p>We both have quite a bit of programming experience and we both have a passion for art which lets us combine our skills really well. This is our second lab together, and so far we are a great team! Shared passions include drawing, programming, and video games. Although we have already worked together twice now we would love to continue to collaborate in the future if permitted. We are a killer team and we cannot wait to show you what we can do together.</p>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Using HTML and CSS to create a webpage</p>
			</div>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I could not figure out why transforming and flipping my image would only perform one of them.  
						I figured out that writing transform in CSS twice will override the previous transform.  
						So you put your scale and translate in the same transform property</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>It went well, I wish I could have found an easier way to put the images at the bottom of a div.  
						It took a lot of time to position them and the background correctly.
