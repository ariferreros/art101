          <p>
            I realized if I opened specifically the lab3 folder in VSCode, the
            site.css would not be recognized and my page would look different. I
            had to open the Art101 folder to see the site.css styles.
          </p>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            It went well. Not much energy had to be put into this assignment as
            it the guide was very clear and easy to follow.
